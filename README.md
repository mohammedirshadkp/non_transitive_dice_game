Non-Transitive Dice Game

Description
This project is a JavaScript-based implementation of a non-transitive dice game. Non-transitive dice are a special set of dice for which the relation "is more likely to roll a higher number" is not transitive. The game includes an interactive command-line interface where players can select dice, make guesses, and roll dice to determine the winner.

Features
Determine First Player: The game uses HMAC and a random key to determine the first player.

Fair Dice Rolls: Dice rolls are generated fairly using random values.

Help Table: Displays a probability table showing the chances of each dice winning.

Interactive Gameplay: Allows users to select dice, make guesses, and play the game.
